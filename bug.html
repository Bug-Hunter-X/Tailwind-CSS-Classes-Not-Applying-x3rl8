I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements.  The classes were defined in my `tailwind.config.js` file and seemed to be valid, but they had no effect on the rendered HTML.  I checked my CSS file for errors, and ensured my Tailwind directives were correctly placed within my HTML file (at the top of the `<head>`).  I also checked for any typos in the class names. The issue persisted even after restarting my development server and clearing my browser cache.
